### **1. Sectional Analysis & Synthesis**

**Abstract & Introduction**  
- **Core research problem**: Developing general-purpose scientific AI agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by mastering complex, frontier-level knowledge.  
- **Hypothesis**: A tool-augmented reasoning agent (X-Master) combined with a scattered-and-stacked multi-agent workflow (X-Masters) can achieve state-of-the-art performance on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning.  
- **Objectives**:  
  - Construct a foundational agent architecture (X-Master) using code as an interaction language for tool augmentation.  
  - Validate capabilities via leading performance on HLE.  
  - Open-source the solution to democratize access and foster innovation.  
- **Significance**:  
  - HLE is a highly challenging benchmark curated by global experts, serving as a proxy for scientific discovery aptitude.  
  - Prior SOTA models (OpenAI, Google) achieved ~26.6–26.9% but were closed-source; this work bridges the gap with open models.  
  - First system to exceed 30% on HLE (32.1%), demonstrating the viability of inference-time computation over model retraining.  

**Methods**  
- **Study design**: Computational framework leveraging open-source LLMs (DeepSeek-R1) for agentic reasoning.  
- **Key components**:  
  - **X-Master agent**:  
    - Uses Python code as a universal interaction language to call tools (e.g., web search, web parse, SciPy/NumPy).  
    - Implements *Initial Reasoning Guidance*—prompt engineering to induce agentic behavior in non-agentic base models.  
    - Supports iterative tool invocation (Figure 2).  
  - **X-Masters workflow**:  
    - *Scattering*: Parallel generation of 5 diverse solutions by **Solver** agents, refined by **Critic** agents.  
    - *Stacking*: **Rewriter** agents synthesize solutions; **Selector** picks the best output (Figure 3).  
  - **Custom tools**:  
    - *Web search*: Retrieves entity facts, webpage previews, and related queries.  
    - *Web parse*: Extracts content from general/scientific pages (with fallback to PDF).  
- **Innovations & limitations**:  
  - 💡 *Code as interaction language* enables flexibility, accuracy, and compatibility with existing libraries.  
  - 💡 *Scattered-and-stacked workflow* mirrors RL rollouts, balancing exploration (breadth) and exploitation (depth).  
  - ⚠️ *Limitations*: Reliance on external tools (e.g., Google Search); no multimodal support; latency from iterative tool use.  

**Results**  
- **Key findings**:  
  - **X-Masters achieved 32.1% on HLE**, surpassing OpenAI (26.6%) and Google (26.9%) (Figure 1).  
  - **Ablation studies** (Table 1):  
    - Tool augmentation (+3.4% over base model).  
    - Critic refinement (+3.9%).  
    - Rewriter synthesis (+5.6%).  
    - Selector finalizes gains (+1.5%).  
  - **Domain-specific performance**:  
    - Biology/Medicine: 27.6% vs. 17.3% (Biomni) and ~26% (STELLA) (Figure 5).  
    - TRQA-lit benchmark: 67.4% SOTA (Figure 6).  
- **Critical figures**:  
  - **Figure 7**: Rewriting stage increases solution correctness (e.g., 5x fully correct solutions).  
  - **Table 2**: Scattering + stacking synergy boosts accuracy by 7.1% over ablated versions.  

**Discussion & Conclusion**  
- **Interpretation**:  
  - X-Master’s code-driven tool interaction and X-Masters’ workflow enable human-like problem-solving (e.g., adapting to tool failures; Figures 8–10).  
  - Workflow design parallels RL rollouts—scattering explores diverse paths; stacking refines optimal solutions.  
- **Broader implications**:  
  - Democratizes SOTA agent capabilities via open-source release.  
  - Foundation for SciMaster series (e.g., domain-specific scientific agents).  
- **Future directions**:  
  - End-to-end trained agents internalizing tool-use capabilities.  
  - Multimodal support and specialized scientific tools.

### **2. Critical Evaluation & Attention Signals**

**Key Contributions**  
1. 💡 **X-Master architecture**: Generalizes tool use via code as interaction language, eliminating manual tool-specific prompts.  
2. 💡 **X-Masters workflow**: Scattered-and-stacked process enhances reasoning breadth/depth, achieving SOTA on HLE.  
3. 💡 **Open-source framework**: Full implementation (tools, workflow) for replication and innovation.  

**Critical Questions to Preempt**  
- **Problem-Method Alignment**: *Why code-based interaction?*  
  - Code offers universality, precision, and library compatibility, enabling flexible tool orchestration without retraining (Section 2.2).  
- **Result Validity**: *Are conclusions robust?*  
  - Ablations (Tables 1–2) and multi-run evaluations support gains. Tool fallbacks (e.g., web parse → PDF) mitigate errors. *However*, HLE’s text-only subset may not reflect multimodal challenges.  
- **Field Context**: *How does this challenge existing paradigms?*  
  - Outperforms specialized agents (e.g., Biomni, STELLA) using minimal tools, proving general > domain-specific design. Advances open-source competitiveness against closed models.  

**Underappreciated Insights**  
- **Initial Reasoning Guidance**: Simple prompt trick to "convert" non-agentic models into agents, reducing fine-tuning needs.  
- **Workflow efficiency**: Critics/Rewriters correct errors *before* final selection, minimizing error propagation (Figure 7).  
- **Tool robustness**: Cases show adaptive tool retries (e.g., Figure 8: parsing fails → switch source).
